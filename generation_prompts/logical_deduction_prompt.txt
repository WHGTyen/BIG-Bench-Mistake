A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects. Describe your thought process step-by-step using Thought 1, Thought 2, ... etc.

The following statements each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent.
- In a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Amy, Eli, Eve, Bob, and Avery.
- Eve finished above Bob.
- Eli finished third.
- Amy finished below Avery.
- Avery finished second to last.
Q: Given the above statements, which of the following is correct?
Options:
(A) Amy finished first
(B) Eli finished first
(C) Eve finished first
(D) Bob finished first
(E) Avery finished first
Thought 1: To answer the question, I need to identify the positions of all five golfers. I should first find and look through any statements about absolute positions of golfers. Then, if there are remaining gaps, I can look through statements about relative positions and find the final order by process of elimination.
Thought 2: Eli finished third. There are five golfers in total, so Eli is in the middle.
Thought 3: So from first to last: first and second can be any golfer, then third is Eli, then fourth and fifth can be any golfer.
Thought 4: Avery finished second to last. There are five golfers in total, so Avery is fourth.
Thought 5: So from first to last: first and second can be any golfer, then third is Eli, then fourth is Avery, and fifth can be any golfer.
Thought 6: Amy finished below Avery. Previously, we concluded that Avery is fourth and there are only a total of 5 golfers, so Amy must be fifth.
Thought 7: So from first to last: first and second can be any golfer, then third is Eli, then fourth is Avery, then fifth is Amy.
Thought 8: Eve finished above Bob. Previously, we concluded that first and second are the only unknown golfers, so they must be Eve and Bob. Since Eve finished above Bob. Eve must be first, and Bob must be second.
Thought 9: So from first to last: first is Eve, then second is Bob, then third is Eli, then fourth is Avery, then fifth is Amy.
Thought 10: According to this ordering, the person who finished first is Eve. So the answer is (C)

The following statements each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent.
- On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book.
- The green book is to the right of the white book.
- The orange book is to the right of the green book.
Q: Given the above statements, which of the following is correct?
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
Thought 1: To answer the question, I need to identify the positions of all three books. I should first find and look through any statements about absolute positions of books. Then, if there are remaining gaps, I can look through statements about relative positions and find the final order by process of elimination.
Thought 2: The green book is to the right of the white book, so the green book cannot be the leftmost and the white book cannot be the rightmost.
Thought 3: So from left to right: first is the white book or the orange book, then second can be any book, then third is the green book or the orange book.
Thought 4: The orange book is to the right of the green book, so the orange book cannot be the leftmost. We previously concluded that the leftmost book is the white book or the orange book, so the leftmost book must be the white book.
Thought 5: The orange book is to the right of the green book, so the green book cannot be the rightmost. We previously concluded that the rightmost book is the green book or the orange book, so the rightmost book must be the orange book.
Thought 6: By process of elimination, the middle book must be the green book.
Thought 7: So from left to right: first is the white book, then second is the green book, then third is the orange book. 
Thought 8: According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book. So the answer is (A)

The following statements each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent.
- On a shelf, there are five books: a red book, a gray book, a white book, a blue book, and a green book.
- The white book is to the left of the gray book.
- The gray book is the second from the left.
- The red book is the second from the right.
- The blue book is to the right of the red book.
Q: Given the above statements, which of the following is correct?
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
(D) The blue book is the leftmost
(E) The green book is the leftmost
Thought 1: To answer the question, I need to identify the positions of all five books. I should first find and look through any statements about absolute positions of books. Then, if there are remaining gaps, I can look through statements about relative positions and find the final order by process of elimination.
Thought 2: The gray book is second from the left. So from left to right: first can be any book, then second is the gray book, then third, fourth, and fifth can be any book.
Thought 3: The red book is second from the right. So from left to right: first can be any book, then second is the gray book, then third can be any book, then fourth is the red book, then fifth can be any book.
Thought 4: The blue book is to the right of the red book. We previously concluded that the red book is second from the right, so the blue book must be the fifth book.
Thought 5: So from left to right: first can be any book, then second is the gray book, then third can be any book, then fourth is the red book, then fifth is the blue book.
Thought 6: The white book is to the left of the green book. We previously concluded that the gray book is the second from the left, so the white book must be the leftmost.
Thought 7: By process of elimination, the third book must be the green book.
Thought 8: So from left to right: first is the white book, then second is the gray book, then third can be any book, then fourth is the red book, then fifth is the blue book.
Thought 9: According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book. So the answer is (C)
