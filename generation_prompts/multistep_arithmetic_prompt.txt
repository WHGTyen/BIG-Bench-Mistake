Q: ((-4 * -9 + -9 * 5) + (4 * 6 - -6 - 4)) * ((9 - 6 + -2 - 2) * (-2 * -5 - 6 * 7)) =
Thought 1: Let's recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Thought 2: This equation can be written as "(A + B) * (C * D)", where A = (-4 * -9 + -9 * 5) and B = (4 * 6 - -6 - 4) and C = (9 - 6 + -2 - 2) and D = (-2 * -5 - 6 * 7).
Thought 3: Let's calculate A = (-4 * -9 + -9 * 5) = ((-4 * -9) + (-9 * 5)) = (36 + (-9 * 5)) = (36 + -45) = -9.
Thought 4: Let's calculate B = (4 * 6 - -6 - 4) = ((4 * 6) - -6 - 4) = ((24) - -6 - 4) = ((24 - -6) - 4) = ((30) - 4) = 26.
Thought 5: Let's calculate C = (9 - 6 + -2 - 2) = ((9 - 6) + -2 - 2) = ((3) + -2 - 2) = ((3 + -2) - 2) = ((1) - 2) = -1.
Thought 6: Let's calculate D = (-2 * -5 - 6 * 7) = ((-2 * -5) - (6 * 7)) = ((10) - (6 * 7)) = (10 - (42)) = -32.
Thought 5: Then, the final equation is (A + B) * (C * D) = (-9 + 26) * (-1 * -32) = (17) * (-1 * -32) = 17 * (32) = 544. So the answer is 544

Q: ((((9 * 7 - -5 + 4) * (7 * -1 * -2 + 1)) - ((-4 - 6 + -6 * -8) * (5 + 7 - -6 - -7))) - (((-3 - -4 - -7 - 3) + (-3 * 4 - 3 + -5)) - ((7 - 2 - 2 - -7) + (5 + -1 - -3 * 7)))) =
Thought 1: Let's recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Thought 2: This equation can be written as "((A * B) - (C * D)) - ((E + F) - (G + H))", where A = (9 * 7 - -5 + 4) and B = (7 * -1 * -2 + 1) and C = (-4 - 6 + -6 * -8) and D = (5 + 7 - -6 - -7) and E = (-3 - -4 - -7 - 3) and F = (-3 * 4 - 3 + -5) and G = (7 - 2 - 2 - -7) and H = (5 + -1 - -3 * 7).
Thought 3: Let's calculate A = (9 * 7 - -5 + 4) = ((9 * 7) - -5 + 4) = ((63) - -5 + 4) = ((63 - -5) + 4) = ((68) + 4) = 72.
Thought 4: Let's calculate B = (7 * -1 * -2 + 1) = ((7 * -1 * -2) + 1) = ((-7) * -2 + 1) = ((-7 * -2) + 1) = ((14) + 1) = 15.
Thought 5: Let's calculate C = (-4 - 6 + -6 * -8) = (-4 - 6 + (-6 * -8)) = (-4 - 6 + (48)) = ((-4 - 6) + 48) = ((-10) + 48) = 38.
Thought 6: Let's calculate D = (5 + 7 - -6 - -7) = ((5 + 7) - -6 - -7) = ((12) - -6 - -7) = ((12 - -6) - -7) = ((18) - -7) = 25.
Thought 7: Let's calculate E = (-3 - -4 - -7 - 3) = ((-3 - -4) - -7 - 3) = ((1) - -7 - 3) = ((1 - -7) - 3) = ((8) - 3) = 5.
Thought 8: Let's calculate F = (-3 * 4 - 3 + -5) = ((-3 * 4) - 3 + -5) = ((-12) - 3 + -5) = ((-12 - 3) + -5) = ((-15) + -5) = -20.
Thought 9: Let's calculate G = (7 - 2 - 2 - -7) = ((7 - 2) - 2 - -7) = ((5) - 2 - -7) = ((5 - 2) - -7) = ((3) - -7) = 10.
Thought 10: Let's calculate H = (5 + -1 - -3 * 7) = (5 + -1 - (-3 * 7)) = (5 + -1 - (-21)) = ((5 + -1) - -21) = ((4) - -21) = 25.
Thought 11: Then, the final equation is ((A * B) - (C * D)) - ((E + F) - (G + H)) = ((72 * 15) - (38 * 25)) - ((5 + -20) - (10 + 25)) = ((1080) - (950)) - ((-15) - (35)) = (130) - (-50) = 180. So the answer is 180

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
Thought 1: Let's recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Thought 2: This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Thought 3: Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + (-160)) = -163.
Thought 4: Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - -56) + -9) = ((65) + -9) = 56.
Thought 5: Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219
